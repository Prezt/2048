# 2048
A implementation of the famous 2048 game


### Why 2048?
- I have been a developer for about 3 years now, but I have almost nothing on my own github profile, so this is my very first "independent" project
- This an deeper experiment with front end with pure js, html and css
- This is supposed to be fun and engaging, so why not a game?
- Although the rules of this game are very simple, it is quite hard to master, which sounds a lot like a problem a computer would be best solving :)
